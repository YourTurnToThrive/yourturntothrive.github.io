            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Your Turn To Thrive is a visual novel and stage play sequel to YTTD taking place 6 months after massacre ending with Nao Egokoro as the protagonist. Her and Sara Chidouin start over in a fresh environment as they continue to recover from the events of the death game, forming new bonds of mutual support, and unraveling the mystery of their new home. The story is focused around mental health, post-traumatic growth, and overcoming oppressive systems.</p>

                <p>We want to convey each characters mental health experiences in ways that are both psychologically realistic and consistent with their portrayal in YTTD. Nao and Sara are both incredibly powerful characters each with unique strengths and we want that to be reflected in this story, because even in tragedy, life still goes on.</p>
            
                <p>The visual novel is currently being prioritized, and has more content such as optional free time events, minigames, and environmental dialogue. The story will be released in 3 updates roughly similar to the release of Your Turn To Die. Here’s a small amount of what we’ve been working on!</p>
