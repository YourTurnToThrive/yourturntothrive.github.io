## Your Turn To Thrive?
Your Turn To Thrive is a visual novel and stage play sequel to YTTD taking place 6 months after massacre ending with Nao Egokoro as the protagonist. Her and Sara Chidouin start over in a fresh environment as they continue to recover from the events of the death game, forming new bonds of mutual support, and unraveling the mystery of their new home. The story is focused around mental health, post-traumatic growth, and overcoming oppressive systems.

We want to convey each characters mental health experiences in ways that are both psychologically realistic and consistent with their portrayal in YTTD. Nao and Sara are both incredibly powerful characters each with unique strengths and we want that to be reflected in this story, because even in tragedy, life still goes on.

The visual novel is currently being prioritized, and has more content such as optional free time events, minigames, and environmental dialogue. The story will be released in 3 updates roughly similar to the release of Your Turn To Die. Here's a small amount of what we've been working on!

## Some of our backgrounds!

In creating backgrounds for Your Turn To Thrive, our goal was a pixel art style similar to Your Turn To Die, but with the ability to display even small objects in enough detail for the environmental point and click elements similar to AI The Somnium Files. To do this, we've made a process to create pixel art backgrounds using real-world photography.

This story takes place in a college setting, so we went around colleges, focusing on liminal spaces, to capture the vibe of this YTTD sequel! These aren't our finalized images, but we think they're looking pretty good :)

## Some of our music!

"There's nothing to fear in failure. A person's life does not end there. / As long as you live on... Happiness will surely come to you!" - Kazumi Mishima [src](https://yourturntodie.fandom.com/wiki/Chapter_1,_Part_Two/Prologue)

Courage in Tragedy is our first public part of the OST, and is meant to be a followup to YTTD's Even in Tragedy combining Day of Tragedy and Step of Courage. Your Turn To Die primarily uses GarageBand loops and For Your Turn To Thrive's OST we wanted to do the same for many of our tracks. YTTT will also contain tracks composed by @[crescendotto](https://crescendotto.com/).
